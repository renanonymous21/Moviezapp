The animation is bright, the human cast delivers enjoyably goofy performances, and the film stays true to the original cartoon’s roots. It isn’t super funny nor creative, but the fun story about a celebrity wedding gone awry and a stuffy New York City hotel that employs a cat to rid them of a mouse problem lays the groundwork for a bit of amusing mayhem.\r\n\r\nBlending classic animation with live action, the effects are better than expected. The actors (including Chloë Grace Moretz, Michael Peña, Pallavi Sharda, and Colin Jost) do a great job interacting with their cat and mouse counterparts, and the cartoonish elements are reminiscent of the classic Tom and Jerry of the past. The story rekindles the rivalry between the two, but is updated for modern audiences.\r\n\r\nThe physical comedy and sight gags are good for most of the giggles, but that’s where the humor stops. There’s also a lot of unnecessary potty humor and a few questionable plot points (the movie does little to rise above certain stereotypes) that may feel cringe-worthy to some adults.\r\n\r\n“Tom and Jerry” isn’t noteworthy at all, but it’s not awful, either. There’s enough here to entertain most kids for a couple of hours.","created_at":"2021-03-09T15:42:27.392Z","id":"60479763c4ad590044e8dc85","updated_at":"2021-03-09T15:42:27.392Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/60479763c4ad590044e8dc85"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}
